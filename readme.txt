Multilingual Extended Profiles in multisite BuddyPress

== Description ==

You have made your BuddyPress multilingual by installing it on a multisite WordPress with a different language for each site and you are using the BP_ENABLED_MULTIBLOG constant to make BuddyPress available on each sub-site. If that is your setup, you will find that the extended profile field names are only available in one language. Activate this plugin on each sub-site that has a different language, then go to:

`Dashboard -> Users -> XProfile Translation`

and translate all profile field names and descriptions to your liking.
